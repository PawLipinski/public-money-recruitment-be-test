- As there is no communication with the db, I implemented "repositories" to have "single source of truth" about the objects
- To prevent modifying objects out of repository all the basic models implement prototype pattern, and repositories return deep copies of them
- Booking logic has been slightly changed - since new model (Unit) has been introduced, it was most reasonable to create bookings per Unit object. 
    Previously only number of units was checked and if number of the existing bookings at the same time was even to the number of Units - new booking was rejected.
    Right now one Unit needs to be available for the whole booking time to make a booking (which wasn't the case for previous approach).
    I find the new approach slightly better as it wouldn't result in a situation when someone needs to change the room during their stay. 
    I haven't implemented mechanism to move the bookings between units for the sake of  optimization (I have left a commented code that works "the old way" in the new code though).

Â¡Hasta luego!
